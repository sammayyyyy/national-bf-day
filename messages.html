        You are truly the best thing that has ever happened to me, love. I don't care what hardships we may have to go through in life, as long as we get to go through them together. As a girl who thought she was incapable of being loved, you have shown me what it's like to feel loved to the fullest since day one. You put up with my worst moments, and honestly I applaud you for that. You've given me so much patience, so much grace, so much time, and so much love. I am so proud to be your girlfriend, and I don't ever want you to feel underappreciated as a boyfriend. You are the BEST boyfriend anyone could ever have, and I am in disbelief that I am the girl you give your love to. I will never take you for granted my love. I will always cherish the love that you share with me, and I promise to always share my love with you. No matter how much physical distance there is between us, I will always try to find a way to ensure that you feel the love that I have for you. Even if it's just through a screen, because I would go lengths for you, Sefu. Thank you for all that you do for me as not only my boyfriend, but as my best friend and as my partner. I never want to live my life without you again. You've given me the most unconditional love, and my heart can't seem to fit it all. I feel so overwhelmed with my love for you and with my need to be affectionate with you. The day we finally get to touch each other for the first time, is the day that I will get to show you just how much I love you and just how much I need you. I love you so much. The only time I ever want to lose you as my boyfriend is the day that I gain you as my fiance, as well as the day that I gain you as my husband. And even then, I will still appreciate the days that you were as my boyfriend, because your efforts and your love will never go unnoticed by me. I love you. Thank you for being the best boyfriend that I could ever ask for.
